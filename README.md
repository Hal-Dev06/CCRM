Campus Course & Records Manager (CCRM)
1. Project Overview üìñ
The Campus Course & Records Manager (CCRM) is a console-based Java application designed for an educational institute to manage its core academic records. It provides functionalities for student management, course administration, enrollment, grading, and data persistence through file operations.

This project is built using Java SE and demonstrates a wide range of core Java principles, including Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), modern file I/O with NIO.2, the Streams and Date/Time APIs, and fundamental design patterns.

2. Evolution of Java (Key Milestones) timeline
JDK 1.0 (1996): The initial release of Java. "Write Once, Run Anywhere."

J2SE 5.0 (2004): A major release that introduced generics, annotations, enums, and the for-each loop, significantly improving type safety and code readability.

Java SE 8 (2014): A revolutionary release that brought lambda expressions, the Stream API, and a new Date and Time API (java.time), marking Java's entry into functional-style programming.

Java SE 11 (2018): The first Long-Term Support (LTS) release under the new six-month release cadence, introducing the new HTTP Client API and the ability to run single-file source code programs.

Java SE 17 (2021): The next LTS release, bringing enhancements like sealed classes and pattern matching for instanceof, further refining the language.

3. Java Editions: ME vs SE vs EE üñ•Ô∏èüì±üè¢
A comparison of the three main Java editions.
Java ME (Micro Edition)
Purpose: For small, resource-constrained devices.
Target: Old feature phones, smart cards, and embedded systems (like printers or TV set-top boxes).
Key Features: Lightweight, small footprint, and specific APIs for mobile functionalities. It's a subset of Java SE.

Java SE (Standard Edition)
Purpose: The core Java platform for general-purpose computing.
Target: Desktop applications, servers, and Android development.
Key Features: Includes the core Java libraries, the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), and APIs for networking, databases (JDBC), and graphical user interfaces (Swing, AWT). It's the foundation for all Java development.

Java EE (Enterprise Edition)
Purpose: For large-scale, distributed, and secure enterprise applications.
Target: E-commerce sites, banking applications, and complex web services.
Key Features: Builds on top of Java SE, adding powerful APIs for web development (Servlets, JSP), business logic (EJB), and database interaction (JPA). It is a superset of Java SE.

4. Java Architecture: JDK vs JRE vs JVM ‚öôÔ∏è
The core components of the Java platform are explained.
JVM (Java Virtual Machine): An abstract machine that provides the runtime environment in which Java bytecode can be executed. It's the component that makes "Write Once, Run Anywhere" possible. Think of it as the engine that runs the Java code.

JRE (Java Runtime Environment): The software package that contains everything needed to run a Java application. It includes the JVM, core libraries, and other supporting files. If you only want to run Java programs, the JRE is all you need. Think of it as the car‚Äîit has the engine (JVM) and all the necessary parts to drive.

JDK (Java Development Kit): The full-featured software development kit for Java. It contains everything in the JRE, plus development tools like the compiler (javac), debugger (jdb), and archiver (jar). If you want to write and compile Java programs, you need the JDK. Think of it as the mechanic's garage‚Äîit has the car (JRE) plus all the tools to build and repair it.

5. Installation & Setup (Windows) üõ†Ô∏è
5.1. JDK Installation
Download the JDK installer for Windows from the official Oracle website or an alternative like Adoptium.

Run the installer and follow the on-screen instructions.
Set the JAVA_HOME environment variable to point to your JDK installation directory (e.g., C:\Program Files\Java\jdk-17).
Add the JDK's bin directory to the system's Path variable (e.g., %JAVA_HOME%\bin).
Verify the installation by opening a Command Prompt and running java -version.

Of course. Here is a complete README.md file template based on your project requirements.

You will need to add your own screenshots in the indicated places to complete it.

Create a new Java Project via File -> New -> Java Project.
Name your project (e.g., CCRM_Project) and ensure the correct JRE is selected.
Create packages by right-clicking the src folder and selecting New -> Package.
Create classes within those packages.
To run the application, right-click the Main.java file and select Run As -> Java Application.

Of course. Here is the "Project Features to Code Mapping" section presented as a descriptive list with headings instead of a table.

6. Project Features to Code Mapping üó∫Ô∏è
This section maps the required technical concepts to their implementation in the source code.

Code Organization
Packages: The entire project is organized into a clear package structure as required. This includes 

edu.ccrm.domain for data models, edu.ccrm.service for business logic, and edu.ccrm.cli for the user interface, demonstrating modular design.

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
Inheritance: The Student.java and Instructor.java classes demonstrate inheritance by extending the abstract Person.java class.
Abstraction: The concept is shown through the abstract class Person, which defines a common structure and abstract methods that subclasses must implement.
Encapsulation: All domain classes (like Student and Course) use private fields with public getters and setters to protect the data.
Polymorphism: This is demonstrated when a common Person reference can point to either a Student or Instructor object, and calling a method like getProfileDetails() invokes the correct version from the subclass.

Design Patterns
Singleton Pattern: The AppConfig.java class is implemented as a Singleton to ensure only one instance exists for managing application-wide settings.
Builder Pattern: The Course.java class uses a static nested Builder for constructing complex course objects in a readable, step-by-step manner.

Exception Handling
Custom Exceptions: The project includes custom checked exceptions like MaxCreditLimitExceededException.java to handle specific business rule violations.
Standard Handling: try-catch-finally blocks are used in the MainMenu.java class for robust input handling, and throws clauses are used in service methods to propagate checked exceptions.

Modern Java APIs
Lambdas & Streams API: The CourseService.java class heavily uses lambda expressions and the Stream API for searching and filtering course data efficiently.
NIO.2 (File I/O): All file operations in ImportExportService.java and BackupService.java use the modern java.nio.file package, including Path and Files for robust I/O.

Date/Time API: The new java.time API is used for handling timestamps, such as the registrationDate in Student.java and for creating timestamped backup folders in BackupService.java.

Core Language Features

Enums with Fields: Grade.java and Semester.java are implemented as enums with private fields and constructors to represent a fixed set of constants with associated data.
Recursion: The BackupService.java class contains a recursive method, calculateDirectorySize(Path path), to demonstrate a recursive algorithm for traversing a directory tree.
Interfaces: The project demonstrates the use of an interface, such as Searchable<T>, which can be implemented by service classes to define a contract for search functionality.
